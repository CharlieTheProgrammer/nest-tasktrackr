I need to create the following models:

1. Project
  name
  entries: Entry[]



2. User
  email
  password
  settings?


3. Category
  name
  hidden


4. Entry
  category_id
  entry_date
  entry_description
  start_time
  end_time
  total_time

5. Stats? I think some of these are dynamically generated
  timeSpentTodayOnAllProjects
  timeSpentTodayOnSelectedProject
  timeSpentOnAllProjects
  timeSpentOnSelectedProject
