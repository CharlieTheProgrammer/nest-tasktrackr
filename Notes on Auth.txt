There are 2 parts to the authentication.

#1 Local strategy
This is in charge of getting the user's login and password and validating them.
If there's an issue, a 401 error will be thrown.
If all good, a signed JWT will be created. User information will be included in
token.

This route is marked as Public and of course, the login route is specifically
marked to use local strategy.

#2. JWT strategy
This does two things
  1. Validates any JWT that hits any of the protected routes, which as of now, are 
  all the routes except for the login route. This has been added at a global level
  through the app module. 
  
  2. When the token is validated, the validate function adds whatever is returned
  from the function to the req object. In my case, req.user. This can then be 
  accessed from any controller by using the @Request() req decorator.
